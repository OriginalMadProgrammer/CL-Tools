# CL-Tools - Command Line tools for UNIX style shells. 

Assorted command line tools in different languages.

## pushd.pl
Greatly extend the native push/pop, and even cd, commands of shells using a perl script.

The big wins are:

* The ability to symbolically search the stack using path fragments.
* Ability to "rise" entries rather than rotating so popular directories rise to the top of the stack. 
* The ability to preload directory stack during login.
* Nifty cd features borrowed from other shells.

This script shows its perl-4 herriatage.
