.SH DESCRIPTION
This family of commands provides a friendly way of
selecting, and reselecting, directories from shell commands.
Previously "pushed" directories are remembered in a directory stack
allowing them to be quickly reselected by stack position number
\fI\&or by symbolic names using a fragment of a name in the stack\fP.
Stacks may also be preloaded with frequently used directories.
.LP
The \fB\&pushd.pl\fP family provide enhancements and extensions over
directory stacks built into typical shells.
They may be used with older shells that do not support native stack operations
or replace existing stack commands with more useful commands.
.LP
Users do not directly use \fB\&pushd.pl\fP but rather use
functions, or aliases, set up during shell initialization.
These aliases are used as normal shell commands.
See PROFILE for typical setups.
Internally new directories are selected with the shell's built in
\fBcd\fP command.
.LP
Full details on this family of commands are found here.
A shorter, more general user level text, is available at some sites in the
\fBpd\fP(1) manual page.
.
.LP
Available user commands follow:
.LP
.ti -\w'\0'u
\fBpushd\fP | \fBpd\fP
.br
\fBpushd\fP and \fBpd\fP select a new directory as \fBcd\fP(1) does.
The current directory is pushd onto a directory stack
before selecting a new directory.
If no arguments are provided,
the top two entries in the stack are exchanged.
.LP
The name of the new directory is printed to standard out unless
the \fB-s\fP option is used.
Typically only interactive shells would print names.
.LP
The differences between \fBpushd\fP and \fBpd\fP are subject
to local configuration.
Typically \fB\&pd\fP "rises" the stack... pulls the requested directory
to the top without rotating the stack;
the order of the other directories remain unchanged
(see \fB\-r\fP option).
\fB\&pushd\fP typically rotates the stack in a more classic manner.
Further \fB\&pd\fP tends to remove problem directories from the stack
(see \fB\-x\fP option).
See appropriate OPTIONS for all possible differences.
.LP
.ti -\w'\0'u
\fBpopd\fP
.br
\fBpopd\fP pops the top directory from the directory stack to
return to the previous directory.
The name of the original current directory is lost.
.LP
The name of the new directory is printed to standard out unless
the \fB-s\fP option is used.
.LP
.ti -\w'\0'u
\fBdirs\fP
.br
\fBdirs\fP lists the current entries in the stack,
starting with the current directory.
.LP
.ti -\w'\0'u
\fBpushd.pl\fP
.br
\fBpushd.pl\fP is intended for direct use by people installing the associated manual
page on the system.
This page should be properly installed in the local user manual pages.
.
.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "\0\0+\fI\&n\fP" \w'\0\0\0MM'u
\fBpushd pd\fP:
.br
Rotates the stack the specified number of levels.
Zero requests no rotation (stack remains unchanged).
.IP
This numeric rotate feature becomes less useful the deeper the stack
as you have to know the depth of the desired entry in the stack.
See the \fB=\fP option for 
selecting existing stack members symbolically.
.IP
NOTE: 
Shells with built-in \fBpushd\fP commands rarely support "0" as a valid count.
Avoid "0" in scripts if you want to be 
portable to built-in directory stack commands.
.
.IP "\0\0\-1\fP"
Force dirs to only list one directory per-line.
.
.IP "\0\0\-r\fP"
\fBpushd pd\fP:
.br
Rise name/Reorder stack.
Any "+" and "=" rotations are not to rotate the stack.
The specified directory is to be moved from its current position to
become the new top-level directory.
.IP
The hole is closed up and
any remaining entries in the stack retain their original order.
.
.IP "\0\0\-s\fP"
\fBpopd pushd pd\fP:
.br
Silence.
Do not print the new current directory after it is selected.
.
.IP "\0\0\-S\fP"
\fBdirs popd pushd pd\fP:
.br
Sort stack after any new directory has been selected.
All stack entries, but the current directory, 
are sorted in simple alphabetical order.
.IP
On \fBdirs\fP commands, only the printed stack is affected.
.
.IP "\0\0\-x\fP"
Duplicate or unselectable directory names are removed from the stack.
On \fBdirs\fP commands, only the printed stack is affected.
.IP
The current directory is not always considered during duplicate entry removal.
This is not a bug, but a feature.
.
.IP "\0\0=\fI\&path\fP"
\fB\&pd\fP and \fB\&pushd\fP:
.br
Name of directory already in the stack, or a fragment of that name. 
Allows users to return to previously "pushed" directories
by name rather than rotation numbers. 
Any sufficiently unique name fragment should work.
\fBpd\fP searches the stack using a "best match" algorithm.
If the name fragment is too ambiguous, the first best match is used.
.IP
The stack is rotated by the appropriate number of elements to select the
requested directory.
Internally the \fB=\fP request is converted to a \fB+\fP request and \fB+\fP
performs the actual stack rotation.
If the wrong directory is selected due to an ambiguous path,
repeating \fBpushd\fP commands should eventually find the desired directory
while
repeating \fB\&pd\fP commands tends to toggle between two wrong directories.
.IP
The top-level directory (current directory) is not reselected unless
it is the only possible match.
.
.IP "\0\0\fIpath\fP"
\fBpushd pd\fP:
.br
Name of directory to be selected.
If no directory is provided,
the first two entries on the stack are exchanged.
.IP
If \fIpath\fP is a single hyphen character (\fB-\fP) and several
conditions are met, the environment variable OLDPWD is expected to contain
the directory to be selected.
After a successful select OLDPWD is updated to contain what was
the current directory (e.g., $PWD) when the command was started.
This is feature allows compatibility with newer \fBksh\fP and \fBbash\fP
shells allowing their \fBcd\fP 
commands to seamlessly work with this suite.
.
.
.IP "\0\0\fInew old\fP"
\fBpushd pd\fP:
.br
Mimics the two argument \fBcd\fP command of \fBksh\fP
to change the current directory.
.IP
The current directory path is examined for a character string 
containing \fI\&new\fP.
The first occurrence of this string is replaced by \fIold\fP and
that directory is selected.
The stack is not popped and the '=' symbolic character is not effective.
.IP
The two-argument option is available to all users
regardless of how this push suite is configured or 
the shell being used.
.
.IP "\0\0\+Man\fP"
\fBpushd.pl\fP:
Prints an unformatted man page
for the program.
Pipe into the appropriate *roff program to format it.
.IP
.RS
\fB\0\0pushd.pl \+Man | nroff \-man | more \-s\fP
.RE
.IP
Administrators may also install unformatted man pages:
.LP

\fB\0\0\fBcd \fP\fI/usr/local/man/man1\fP
.br
\fB\0\0pushd.pl \+Man >pushd.pl.1\fP
.br

.IP
NOTE: install under \fBpushd.pl.1\fP to not only be consistent,
but avoid confusion with \fBpushd\fP(1) for \fBcsh\fP(1).
.
.
.
.SH SPECIAL OPTIONS
.LP
The following options are not intended for use on 
regular command lines. As such they are not in the previous SYNOPSIS section.
They are only for use within the profile's function definitions
(e.g., "\fBpd() { eval `pushd.pl \+Pd \-t $*;`; }\fP").
Users are free to put any \- options within their definitions.
.
.IP "\0\0\-c\fP"
\fBpopd pushd pd\fP:
.br
\fBcsh\fP shell.
Must set this if running under C shells.
.
.IP "\0\0\-L\fP"
Logical paths. See \fB\-P\fP for details.
.IP "\0\0\-P\fP"
\fBpushd pd popd\fP:
.br
Physical paths.
When the user's shell \fBpushd\fP
\fI\&as well as the local \fP\fBpwd\fP\fI command,\fP
support the \fB\-L\fP and \fB\-P\fP options,
then the favored value needs to be selected for \fBpushd\fP operations.
\fBpushd\fP was designed for \fB\-P\fP operations so that is suggested.
If omitted,
it uses the shell's default, which tends to be \fB\-L\fP on new shells.
.IP
\fB\-L\fP causes \fBcd\fP to treat symbolic links as physical paths when
setting \fB$PWD\fP.
Use of \fB\-P\fP causes \fBcd\fP to resolve symbolic links into the 
true physical path when setting \fB$PWD\fP.
.IP
NOTE: POSIX.2 compliant \fB\&pwd\fP commands \fIdo not support \-LP\fP.
.
.IP "\0\0\-p\fP"
\fBpopd pushd pd\fP:
.br
Put path name into prompt.
Only intended for older shells that do not have a way to automatically
place the name of the current directory into the shell prompt
(e.g., \fBsh\fP and \fBcsh\fP).
.IP
The PUSHD1 environment variable contains a prefix to place before
the path name (e.g., "", "\fB`hostname`:\fP", "\fB${LOGNAME}@`hostname`\fP").
The PUSHD2 environment variable contains the suffix,
typically 
"\fB$\0\fP" for Bourne based shells and
"\fB%\0\fP" for C shells.
.IP
Use of \fB\-p\fP requires an alias to \fBcd\fP so \fBcd\fP also
sets the prompt.
Other directory commands may also need to set the prompt.
.IP
NOTE: \fBcsh\fP likes to core dump under some OSs when 
trying to set the prompt to current directories.... 
the hard part may be finding a way to avoid the core dumps
(e.g., try \fBset prompt = `cd /tmp; pwd`\fP, 
and I really don't want to hear about 
which OSs like to core dump and which don't!).
.
.
.IP "\0\0\-t\fP"
\fBpd pushd popd\fP:
.br
Tilde shell.
Define if the local shell supports "~" to refer to the users home directory.
If the head of a stack entry matches the HOME environment variable,
a "~" replaces the home directory name.
Used to shorten paths, making them easier to read.
.
.
.
.SH PROFILE
.SH \0\0General Notes
The HISTORICIAL profile was the first profile,
and it was rather basic.
It was found that it was much more practical to have both 
\fBpushd\fP and
\fBpd\fP support \fB=\fP symbolic stack searches.
The main difference between the latest \fBpd\fP and \fBpushd\fP is that
\fBpd\fP raises the stack while \fPpushd\fP rotates the stack.
\fBpd\fP is also more aggressive at cleaning junk out of the stack.
.LP
The practical results is \fBpd\fP is generally the operation of choice,
but if the wrong directory has been fetched from a deep stack 
repeated use of \fBpushd\fP allows users to
step through the stack until the desired 
directory is found. 
Repeated use of \fBpd\fP simply toggles between two wrong directories
while \fBpushd\fP steps through all matching directories.
.
.SH \0\0Bourne Shell Family
A series of shell function declarations in the shell start up file 
provides the proper aliases to pushd.pl.
This is best done in the "per-shell" file (e.g., 
\fB.shrc\fP, 
\fB.kshrc\fP, 
\fB.bashrc\fP):
.LP

NOTE ON \fB\-P\fP: The \fB\-P\fP option must be omitted 
under either older shells or pwd programs that
do not support \fB\-L\fP and \fB\-P\fP options.
Such old shells may also require a \fB\-p\fP option if the 
new directory name is to appear in the command line prompt.
Users may change \fB\-P\fP to a \fB\-L\fP 
under any shell
if that is favored.

.SH \0\0C Shell Family
Unfortunately the original C shells (\fBcsh\fP) were particularly resistant to 
features needed to make this work.
Thankfully the newer \fBtcsh\fP shell does better.
The following indented
note applies only if you are stuck with genuine original \fBcsh\fP shells.
Users of \fBtsch\fP should have no problems using the provided code.

Original \fB\&csh\fP restrictions:

Using \fBpushd.pl\fP to replace \fBcsh\fP's native \fBpushd\fP family
may work under your \fBcsh\fP with the following set up in \fB.cshrc\fP.
It relies on having \fIsome way\fP to tell \fBcsh\fP that a \fBcd\fP command
in the middle of an alias
is to run as itself instead of a recursive \fBcd\fP alias.
as used within \fBpushd.pl\fP's \fBCsh\fP subroutine.
"\fBrepeat 1 cd\fP" has been found to do this on \fBcsh\fP's currently
available to the author (see \fB$UnCshAlias\fB within \fBpushd.pl\fP if you
need to change this).
Good luck on your \fBcsh\fP.
.LP
NOTE:
Once upon a time \fBcsh\fP used to accept "\fB\ecd\fP" to force
the internal \fBcd\fP command,
but this now fails on various \fBcsh\fP shells
the author has access to.  
Original \fBcsh\fP shells may still accept it.

NOTE:
In the above code,  the "alias cd" needs to be on a single line.
In this example the "sed" command has a line break forced as se\fB\en\fPd

.SH HISTORICAL PROFILE
.LP
The following is a bit more conservative version of the profile 
that does not "rise" the stack.
While this was the originally suggested profile,
and some of the documentation in this  manual page is written as if this
historical profile is still used,
experience has found the more feature rich defaults 
in the PROFILE section tend to be more useful. 
This alternate remains documented for historical purposes.
.LP
.nf
pushd() { eval `pushd.pl \-Pt $*;`; }
pd()    { eval `pushd.pl \+Pd \-Pt $*;`; }
.fi
.LP
This changes the difference between \fBpushd\fP and \fBpd\fP from 
"=" support (under this alternate only pd supports "=") and
deletes \fB\-rx\fP options from \fBpd\fP and \fBpushd\fP.
Experience has shown \fB\-rx\fP can be very useful with very deep stacks
so they are now the default.
.LP
\fBcsh\fP users would need to change their profile to select similar options.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.SH \0\0CDPATH
The environment variable CDPATH is used 
when new relative directories cannot be found during push operations.
If defined,
CDPATH is expected to contain a list of colon (:) separated
directory names.
If the requested directory is not found in the current directory
push operations search for the requested directory relative 
to the directories in CDPATH.
The first directory found by this search is selected.
Using "../\fIxyz\fP" can often be used to select directory \fIxyz\fP
 in CDPATH.
.LP
RESTRICTION:
Directory names in CDPATH should start with "/" to make them
absolute path names as relative path names can be very unpredictable.
.
.SH \0\0OLDPWD
Some shells set OLDPWD to 
what the current directory was (e.g., $PWD) \fIbefore\fP
any directory change.
If $OLDPWD is defined
this pushd suite honors this variable in traditional ways
but relies on native \fBcd\fP(1) commands to set it.
.
.SH \0\0PUSHD
The information on the current stack is kept in the environment variable PUSHD.
Stack entries are recorded left to right (top to bottom).
.LP
If the first character of the stack is a colon then the stack contains
colon delimited names. All embedded white space is significant.
.LP
Else for historic purposes stack entries are delimited by any use of
spaces or colons. Historically spaces were used.
.LP
Child processes inherit PUSHD as with any other environment variable.
No information is cached to disk.
Only previously pushed directory names are recorded in this stack.
The top level of the logical stack is the current directory,
which is not recorded in PUSHD.
.
.SH \0\0PUSHD1 and PUSHD2
The PUSHD1 and PUSHD2 environment variables are used under \fB\-p\fP.
See SPECIAL OPTIONS.
.
.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
All severe error messages printed by \fBpushd.pl\fP appear in all upper case 
letters to make them easier to spot in lot files.
Such are always written to standard error.
.LP
Errors in selecting the directory come from the \fBcd\fP command
\fBpushd.pl\fP used to select the directory.
Bad pushes should not change the directory stack.
Bad pops should clear the problem entry from the stack.
.
.
.
.SH RESTRICTIONS
In case of excessive stack growth, 
these commands may start to fail if the length of all entries in the stack 
approaches the maximum command length supported by the shell.
This has never been a problem for the author despite some deep stacks.
.LP
May not work from older "C" shells (see \fBcsh\fP notes in PROFILE).
.LP
Spaces are not allowed to be actual characters in directory names
unless new format PUSHD are used (e.g., leading colon in value).
Any old format PUSHD settings are converted to new format on their first use.
.

.
.SH INSTALLATION
.SH \0\0\0Global Usage
System administrators may not want to make this available to
all users as it is likely to cause problems to shell scripts
that expect the original pushd/popd operations.
Further, shells that do not have a system wide "per shell" 
configuration file cannot be properly configured to use these programs
on a global base.
However, if you want to give it a try anyway...
.LP
System administrators may make these features available to all users
of shell commands by creating a file for each family of shells used
on the system (e.g., Borne Shell vs. C shell) that is valid for all
members of a particular shell family (pushd.sh for Bourne shells
and pushd.csh for C shells).
The file should be read each time a new shell is started up
from the shells start up file.
Reading the file only at login will not do what is needed.
The file must not be executable.
.
.LP
In addition to installing \fBpushd.pl\fP on a location shared by all
users (/user/local/bin/pushd.pl is suggested as a standard location,
providing that works on your system) a man page should be installed.
.LP
\0\0\0pushd.pl +Man >/usr/share/man/man1/pushd.pl.1
.LP
It is important 1) not to overwrite any existing \fBpushd\fP(1) manual page
note how we use pl in our man page file name), and
2) run whatever command is needed to add \fBpushd.pl.1\fP to the \fB\&whatis\fP index
(see \fBwhatis\fP(1), or perhaps another command).
.
.
.SH \0\0\0Individual Users
Individual users can add the appropriate commands to
the configuration file for their shell that is read
each time a new shell is started up.
Note how the suggested PROFILE ensures \fB\-s\fP (silence) is set
if the shell is not interactive.
.LP
Users using multiple shells may wish to
use a personal version of the techniques described in Global Usage.
.LP
Note that individual users may preload PUSHD with any desired list
of directories popular to the current user.
This is a big advantage to allowing individual users to decide if, 
and how,
to use this new pushd.
.
.
.SH BUGS
Genuine Bourne shell (\fBsh\fP(1)) users may find they can't use \fBpushd.pl\fP
in any but the login shell.
This is a restriction of \fBsh\fP itself as \fB.profile\fP is only run at
login and \fB.shrc\fP type files for each shell are not supported.
All other shells should be OK if they have an "each shell" start up file you can
put the function definitions in.
See your shell's manual page.
.
.
.
.SH REQUIREMENTS
Requires at least perl 4 (maybe 5 by now).
.
.
.SH NOTES
While you may think of the stack as the current directory followed by all
previously pushed directories,
the PUSHD environment variable does not contain the current directory.
.LP\" tightly bind previous and following paragraphs together
Users may issue simple \fBcd\fP(1) commands without affecting the 
"pushed" stack in PUSHD.
.LP
Normally the current shell will inherit 
the stack of any ancestral shell that was
also using \fBpushd.pl\fP.
The descendent can not modify any stack put its own (see ENVIRONMENT).
.LP
Totally replaces the previous, and fairly lame, \fBpd.pl\fP program.
.LP
A lamer version of \fBPUSHD.EXE\fP
was available for users of MS-DOS shells.
It may still be, but it is not supported at this time and based on C code.
